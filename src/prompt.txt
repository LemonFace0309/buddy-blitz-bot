In the next two seconds, we will be executing a single action.
Each action is either move left, right, forward, left-forward, right-forward, or nothing.
Output a JSON object, and ONLY a JSON object, with each of these actions as a key, and the probability that our avatar should perform that action as the corresponding value.
Note that the sum of all these probabilities must equal one.
Also include in the JSON object if the avatar should jump as a boolean.
An example of a JSON object is shown below:

{
  "left": 0.12,
  "right": 0,
  "forward": 0.1,
  "left-forward": 0.62,
  "right-forward": 0.04,
  "nothing": 0.12,
  "jump": false
}

Here, our avatar has a 12% chance of moving directly to the left,
a 0% chance of moving directly to the right,
a 10% chance of moving directly forward,
a 62% chance of moving diagonally forward and to the left
a 4% chance of moving diagonally forward and to the right,
and a 12% chance of doing nothing.
The avatar will also not jump while performing this action.
