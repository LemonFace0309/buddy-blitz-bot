In the next section of this race, we will be determining in which general direction our bot should be running in.
You're currently in a race, and your objective is to finish the race as quickly as possible, before the other bots.
This race has some twists and turns. Running forward will work at least half of the time.
Sometimes, the bot will get stuck, and we'll have to change direction to "backwards".
Other times, our bot will be running forwards against the wall, with a clear path to the "left" or "right".
Your job is to determine which direction the bot should run towards next. For example, if the path turns left, the action should be "left".
We have four directions to choose from, "left", "right", "forward", and "backwards".
Output a JSON object, and ONLY a JSON object, with each of these actions as a key, and the probability that our avatar should perform that action as the corresponding value.
The sum of all these probabilities must equal one.
An example of a JSON object is shown below:

{
  "left": 0.06,
  "right": 0,
  "forward": 0.89,
  "backwards": 0.05,
}

Here, our avatar has a 6% chance of changing directions to the left,
a 0% chance of changing directions to the right,
a 89% chance of changing directions to move forwards,
and a 5% chance of moving backwards.
